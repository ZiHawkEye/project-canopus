# Project Canopus
Project Canopus is started by 2 young fellas enrolling in NUS SoC.
The aim of this project is to provide handwritten notes and documentation of lessons that these 2 young fellas attended, to facilitate learning and revision.

<br>
This is an attempt to learn and exercise implementing websites.

This website will insult you and provide **__bad__ user experience**
There will also be notes

stay tuned for live version @[Project Canopus] (projectcanopus.com)
### Things to be done:
- [ ] A general style CSS for all sites
- [ ] Backend: finish controller methods for article model (display article, search, create, modify, delete), add/modify if necessary and update routes accordingly
- [ ] Backend: finish controller methods for user model (search for a user, create, modify, delete), add/modify if necessary and update routes accordingly
- [ ] Backend: implement sanitisation, validation of input and error handling if not sufficient
- [ ] Frontend: implement some components that can interface with the API
- [ ] Eventually convert React App into a static package with npm run build that can be served with Node server for deployment
